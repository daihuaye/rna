                   Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the ritual removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. Typically conducted by a traditional circumciser using a razor blade or knife (with or without anaesthesia), FGM is concentrated in 27 African countries, Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan, and is also found elsewhere in Asia, the Middle East and among diaspora communities around the world. The procedures take place from within days of birth to puberty, and include removal of the clitoral glans, removal of the inner labia and, in the most severe form.
